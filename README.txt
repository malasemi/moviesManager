User Story:
As a user, I want a new Windows application written using Windows Forms that is capable of obtaining basic information
from a SQL Server database related to movies that are entered into a database. 
Further, I want the ability to add, update, and delete existing movies in the database.

##The application's forms will allow a user to interact with the Movies table from a SQL Server database.
##This application retrieves data from the database while also demonstrating the ability to handle the typical CRUD operations(Create, Read, Update, and Delete).

##Note that this application was built using Microsoft visual studio
